## What is the 4-7-8 Breathing Technique?

The 4-7-8 method is a structured breathing pattern developed by Dr. Andrew Weil, based on the ancient yogic practice of pranayama:

- **Breathe in** for 4 seconds
- **Hold** for 7 seconds
- **Breathe out** for 8 seconds

This rhythm activates your parasympathetic nervous system — the body's natural "rest and digest" mode — helping you unwind, reduce anxiety, and fall asleep more easily.

## Scientific Background

A 2023 study published in *Obesity Surgery* ([Kurt Aktaş & Eskici İlgin, 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36480101/)) found that the 4-7-8 breathing technique significantly reduced anxiety levels compared to both standard deep breathing exercises and a control group. The technique has been shown to be a simple yet effective tool for calming the mind and body.

## How It Works

BlueBreath guides your breathing entirely through **haptic vibrations**. Choose how many breathing cycles you'd like to complete (1–30), press start, put your phone under your pillow or hold it in your hand, and let the vibrations tell you when to breathe in, hold, and breathe out.

There's no need to keep the screen on or watch any animations — just close your eyes and follow the rhythm.

## Features

- **Vibration-guided breathing** — follow the rhythm by feel, not by sight
- **6 vibration patterns** — from smooth continuous vibrations to simple discrete buzzes, find the style that feels right for you
- **Adjustable intensity and pulse duration** — fine-tune the vibrations to your preference
- **Finger dial** — quickly select 1–30 repetitions with a satisfying circular dial
- **Works with screen off** — vibrations continue even when the display is off
- **Auto-sleep** — optionally locks your screen when the exercise is complete, so you can drift off without worrying about your phone
- **Beautiful breathing circle** — a calming visual companion for when you do want to watch
