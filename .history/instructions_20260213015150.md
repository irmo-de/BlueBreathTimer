Create me a modern Material 3 Expressive app with the following features:

The app should support the user for this technique:
The 4-7-8 breathing technique is a calming, drug-free, and rapid relaxation method designed to reduce anxiety and aid sleep. Developed by Dr. Andrew Weil, it involves a 4-second nasal inhale, a 7-second hold, and an 8-second mouth exhale. It activates the parasympathetic nervous system to decrease stress. 

- enable vibrations

- the user should be able to select the number of repetitions using a finger dial ui (show the total repetitions and the total time)

- keep the device alive. Give user feedback via vibration. Allow the screen to be off, but keep the vibrations pattern active.

- when the total repetitions are done, send the device to sleep

- Select a light blue color scheme.

- build the app using gradle to check for syntax errors.

- Check for haptic feedback effects for the best implementation

- Allow the user to set different vibration patterns and vibrations strenght.

Ask questions about anything that in not clear before implementing
